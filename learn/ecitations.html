                            <h3>Non-Traffic eCitations</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>Non-Traffic eCitations have a number in the Format of NV1234567.</p>
                                <p>The other big difference it that NV eCitations do not have to have a TCode.</p>
                                <p>Instead the Charge is matched on the Citation Ordinance Number which needs to be the same in the Charge Record for the particular Charge. If they do not match, the eCitation Translation table may be used to translate to the correct charge. Printing the NV ticket produces a slightly different form than the Traffic eCitations.</p>

                                <p>An eCitation Record should be voided if there is for any reason a case is not to be created from it. To void an eCitation Record, type VOID in the Local Case Field and check the ‘Already Used’ box.</p>

                            <h3>What if an eCitation Ticket is Missing?</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>There are several reasons why a ticket might not appear in the eCitation Table.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><b>The Officer did not actually transmit the ticket to the state.</b></p>
                                        <p>The solution is to try to have the officer transmit the tickets again.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><b>The ticket was actually transmitted to another agency such as the county.</b></p>
                                        <p>If the officer has a copy of the ticket, check to see which court is entered.</p>
                                        <div class="captioned-image">
                                            <img src="/images/learn/ecitations/36.jpg" />
                                            <p class="caption"></p>
                                        </div>
                                        <p> The only solution here is for the Officer to create a new ticket or skip the eCitation process and manually enter the ticket in the Cases Table.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><b>There was an error in downloading the eCitation from the State.</b></p>
                                        <p>The ticket could be flagged as already being sent and therefore would not be sent again. The solution is to click on the Download Button so that there are no pending downloads. Click on the Add Record Icon in the upper left of the screen.</p>
                                        <p>Go to the Ticket Field and enter the eCitation Number. Press Tab or Enter.</p>
                                        <p>The ticket would now be downloaded and placed in this new record. Save the Record. If the fields all remain blank, this ticket is not available.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>If none of these solutions work, the Police Department could contact the eCitation People at CAPS (Center for Advanced Public Safety) and have them look at the status of this ticket number.</p>
