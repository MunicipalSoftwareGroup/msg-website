                        To initiate any Payment Function either type Ctrl-M (for Money) or click on the icon. The Initial Payment Screen will then appear.
                    </p><br>


                    <p>
                        While the Initial Payment Screen may default to a given defendant or a given Payment Reason based on the current record, you may take any valid type of payment on any defendant regardless of the record from which you start.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>DEFENDANT</i>
                    <p>
                        The ‘Case Number’ selected must be a Case of the listed Defendant.
                        The Drop Down Field for Case Number will only display this Defendants
                        cases, unless the ‘Payer is not Defendant’ box is checked. If the ‘Payer is
                        not Defendant’ box is checked, any Case Number may be entered.
                        To the right of the case number, the amount owed on this case is displayed. If the case has not yet been worked, the case will be shown to be pending.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        To the right is displayed the number of
                        open cases for this defendant and the
                        number Worked/Pending. Also displayed is the total amount owed.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>EMPLOYEE</i>
                    <p> The Employee logged in is assumed
                        to be the Employee taking the
                        ` payment. If a different Employee
                        is taking the payment, the ‘Change Employee’ button should be clicked and
                        the actual Employee taking the payment should log in.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>DEFENDANT INFORMATION</i>
                    <p> Clicking on the Defendant Information button
                        will display all the information of the Payer.
                        The information displayed is the same as if had been pressed.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>BONDS AVAILABLE</i>
                    <p>The total number of CASH BONDS (if any) and the total amount is displayed.
                        If you are about to APPLY, RETURN, or FORFEIT a Bond, ‘Bond to Use’
                        should display the Bond being acted upon. Press F4 or click the down arrow
                        to see a list of this Defendants Cash Bonds.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>REASON</i>
                    <p>The Reason field defines what type of Action is to take place. If you are
                        in the ‘Cases Table’, the Reason will default to CASE PAYMENT. The Reason field will default depending on the context. Possible choices are:
                    </p><br>

                    <i>CASE PAYMENT</i>
                    <p> - for payments on cases. If this is the initial payment,
                        Case Disposition Update will be displayed (Adjudication, Court
                        Date, etc) for possible change. If this is the initial payment, but Court
                        Costs have been waived, the Exclude Costs should be checked. If a Bond
                        is being applied, the bond must be listed in the ‘Bond to Use’ field.
                        If this is a cost prior to Adjudication (like a Warrant Fee) then the PreAdjudication field should be checked. If the Defendant has multiple
                        cases to pay at once, ‘Group All Costs’ should be checked.
                    </p><br>


                    <i>CASE PAYMENT SETUP</i>
                    <p>– If a case has been adjudicated, but the defendant
                        is not paying initially, the correct fines and costs should be SETUP.
                        This follows CASE PAYMENT exactly with the exception of the
                        Payment Method defaulting to SETUP (instead of CASH). With SETUP, no receipt number is generated as no actual payment is transacted. This exact function could be accomplished by selecting CASE PAYMENT and changing the Payment Method to SETUP.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENT</i>

                    <i>PARKING</i>
                    <p>– If you have Parking Tickets in the separate Parking Ticket Table and not mixed in the ‘Cases’ Table, this is how you take a Parking
                        Payment. The next screen will help you to identify which ticket. If the
                        Payer Name is NOT the payer of this ticket, it should be cleared before
                        going on. Otherwise, the ticket being paid will be limited to those of
                        the Payer.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>VOID RECEIPT</i>
                    <p>
                        – The next screen will help you chose which receipt to void.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>Reprint a Receipt</h2>

                    <i>REFUND RECEIPT</i>
                    <p>
                        - If a receipt needs to be returned, but it is too late to
                        VOID, a REFUND will subtract amounts from the given accounts.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>DRIVING SCHOOL</i>
                    <p>
                        – Payments applied toward records in the ‘Driving
                        School’ Table.

                        - receipts CASH, PROPERTY or SURETY
                        bonds. Although a Case Number or Warrant Number may be
                        referenced, the BOND is taken on the Defendant. No Case Number
                        is required.
                    </p><br>


                    <i>BOND DISPOSE RETURN</i>
                    <i>BOND DISPOSE FORFEIT</i>
                    <i> BOND DISPOSE CIRCUIT</i>
                    <i> BOND DISPOSE APPLY</i>
                    <p>
                        - the disposition of a previously received Cash Bond
                        The Bond being disposed must be referenced in the ‘Bond to Use’ field.
                        The ‘BOND DISPOSE APPLY’ is redundant to a ‘CASE PAYMENT’
                        with a bond reference.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>BOND CONVERT SURETY</i>
                    <p>
                        – converts a SURETY to a CASH BOND.
                        Since this is a Surety Bond and ‘Bond to Use’ is for CASH BONDS,
                        the ‘Bond to Use’ field should be blank. The Surety Bond being converted will be determined in the next screen.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        When your ‘Initial Payment Screen’ is ready, click on OK.
                        You may also press the F9 key for the same results.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>CASE DISPOSITION UPDATE SCREEN</i>
                    <p>
                        If the Payment Action is the Initial Payment on a case, the ‘Case Disposition
                        Update’ screen appears to allow you to input the Adjudication and other
                        possible case information that may need to be changed such as Court Date.
                        You may click OK or press F9 when finished. If no changes are to be made
                        to the Case Record, you may click on CANCEL or press ESC.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>CASE PAYMENT SCREEN</i>
                    <p>
                        Upon first entering the Case Payment Screen, the focus will normally be on
                        the Pay Method defaulted to CASH. You may also select Pay Methods of
                        CHECK, MONEY ORDER, CREDIT CARD, JAIL or SETUP. SETUP would
                        not involve payment actually taken, but instead setting up what is now owed.
                        For all others an amount should be placed in which will
                        then be place in .
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The DATA GRID shows the Case Numbers which would vary only if multiple cases are being paid. The next columns are the Fine/Cost Titles, the Original
                        amount owed, the amount Paid prior to this payment, the Current amounts of
                        this payment and the Resulting Balance. As you put in the amount Tendered
                        and Applied, the Current column will fill with the appropriate amounts from
                        top to bottom. You may optionally edit and adjust where the current amounts
                        are to be applied. You may also adjust the Original amounts and Costs as
                        needed. However, an Original amount may not be adjusted below the amount
                        Paid prior to this payment. Previous payments would need to be first voided.
                        The amount in the Applied field must equal the total amount at the bottom of the Current column. If it does not, a red message will
                        appear below the total Cost reflecting how much to add or subtract.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        Since FINE is a common item for which to adjust the amount, you may type
                        Ctrl-F to enter the FINE in a Pop-up Window.

                        case is to be closed prior to full payment
                        being made. Normally, you will not be
                        checking this box.

                    <p>
                        Printer is the default receipt printer and may be changed. The receipt number
                        should normally be left blank so that the system will generate the next receipt
                        number in sequence. Instead if needed you may manually enter a receipt
                        number. The Print and Screen check boxes determine if the receipt is to be
                        printed to the Printer, the Screen or both.

                        A comment may be added to the Payment record. If the ‘Comment on Reciept’
                        box is checked that comment will also be printed on the receipt.

                        Clicking Restitution will take you to the Restitution Manager
                        for this case.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>PAYMENT PLAN</i>
                    <p>
                        Payment plan allows you to put in a current or start date. Period payments
                        are to be made (MONTHLY, WEEKLY, BI-WEEKY, VARIABLE). If you
                        then specify the amount, the Next Due and Finish Date will be filled in.
                        If instead you click Fixed Finish, the Finish Date will not change, but the amount will be adjusted so that that Finish Date will be completed. The
                        Amount is rounded up to the nearest $5, so that the last payment could be
                        less than the Amount. You may also click Manual and no calculations will
                        be made. You may then fill in the fields as you wish.
                    </p><br>

                        the F9 key. If you wish to abort this process, click on CANCEL or press ESC.
                        If ‘Setup Return’ is checked, the focus will go back to the ‘Initial Payment

                    <p>
                        Miscellaneous Payment Screen has a similar look as the Case Payment Screen.
                        A case may, but does not have to be referenced. The payment record will have
                        the Misc Receipt box checked.

                    <h2>Forfeit, Return, Apply a Bond</h2>
                    <p>
                        Following the same instructions for taking a Case Payment, select the bond

                    <h2>Manage Restitution</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to manage Restitution on a particular case, that case must have
                        Restitution setup in the Payment Manager. Add Restitution as a row in
                        the Initial Fines and Cost setup. You may do this later by beginning to take
                        a Case Payment, adding Restitution and changing the Pay Method to SETUP.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        Once Restitution in place on this case, you need to go to the Restitution
                        Manager to setup the Receiver or Payee of the Restitution. You may display
                        the Restitution Manager by going
                        to the particular case in the Case
                        Table, clicking on the Options
                        Menu, and then clicking on
                        Restitution Manager. This same
                        task may be accomplished by
                        typing Ctrl-R. In the Payment
                        manager on the Case Payment
                        Screen there is a button that will also display the Restitution
                        Manager.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        The Restitution Receivers or Payees need to be entered here. The Amount
                        must be the amount from the Restitution row in the Payment Setup. This
                        amount may be split as needed among various Payees. Each Payee must
                        have a record in the Profile Manager with the name and address. If there is not a record in the Profile Manager for the Payee, one must be created.
                        (See NAME DROP DOWN FIELD in the Field Types Section of this manual.)
                        You may press F4 and start typing the last name or you may type Ctrl-N or
                        right click the field and select ‘Create New Profile’ from that menu.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        There must be one or more Payees with the Amounts owed to them equal to the Restitution setup for the Defendant to pay.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        Once the Payee Name is in place, no further action is needed in Restitution
                        Manager until the Defendant has made payments toward Restitution.
                        If $60 of the Total $100 of Restitution was paid by the defendant the
                        Restitution Manager would look like this:
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        The Amount Column remains at the Original $100. $60 has been received
                        from the Defendant. The Defendant still owes a balance of $40. The court
                        now has $60 that needs to be sent to the Payee. There are Restitution reports that will alert the court that money needs to be sent to the Payee.
                        You acknowledge that the Restitution was actually mailed to the Payee by
                        putting the Date Sent and the optional Check Number in place.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        By clicking OK at the bottom of this screen, you are telling the system that you have sent $60 to the Payee.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        If you were to look at the Restitution Manager now, it would show that the
                        Defendant still has to pay $40 and that the court does not currently owe the
                        Payee any outstanding balance.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        The bottom Restitution Payments Sent grid will show a history of when the court sent the Payee the Restitution it previously collected.

                        are lighter. You may double click in the margin to the left of any record
                        and that record will open up in another window for viewing or editing.

                    <i>PAYMENTS</i>
                    <p>
                        The Payments tab shows all defendant payments on a time basis starting with
                        the most recent. Again, you may left click on the margin to go to that record.

                    <p>
                        Your employee name and password may now be entered.
                        You must first put your name in the “Employee Name” field. This may be accomplished several different ways.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        You may click on the arrow to the right of the employee name field to display a “Drop down” list of employees from which to select your name.

                    <p>
                        Alternatively, you may enter your employee ID number in this field and press either the ENTER or the TAB key. Note that you do not have to enter the leading zeros on the 5 digit employee ID number. Employee ID 00015 may simply be entered as 15.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        You may also enter the first few letters of your last name and press either the ENTER or TAB key. Note that if you enter the first letter or several letters of your last name it must be enough to distinguish it from other Employee names. If you are the only employee whose last name begins with ‘S’, you would only need to enter ‘S’. Should your Name not appear on this list, an Application Administrator would need to add it to the Employee Data Table.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>FIELD FOCUS</i>

                    <i>PASSWORD</i>
                    <p>
                        Once the Employee Name is displayed you should change the FOCUS to the Password field. (with ENTER or TAB) You may type in your password. Your password will remain hidden as asterisks ‘*’ will appear as you type.

                    <p>
                        By setting the appropriate parameter, your Application may be setup to use the WINDOWS LOGIN for Validation. This option will allow you to skip the above Employee Validation Box. Instead the Application will know who you are based on your initial Windows Login to your computer or Network. While this option may be more convenient, it is less secure. Once you have logged on to your computer, anyone could then click on the icon and go directly to the MAIN SCREEN.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>

                        and then on the menu item
                        ‘Quick Search’. Using the
                        shortcut ‘F1’ is much simplier.

                        The white label under the ‘Search for’ field will inform you the various ways to access this table in ‘Quick Search’. If you are searching by name you may
                        enter the last name, comma, space, first name to display that record to select. It’s often easier just to enter the first letter or first few letters of the last name to bring up the list of names.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>

                        You may now scroll up and down this list to find the case you want. Notice
                        that the list is in alphabetical order by name. Pressing Enter on the record you want will cause this screen to disappear and place you on that record.
                        You may also search by Case Number. Entering TR07-1328 will yield:

                    <p>
                        Now you may scroll through the records in ‘Case Number’ order pressing
                        ‘Enter’ on the one to which you wish to go. Likewise in the ‘Case’ Table you
                        may also search by Court Date and UTC Number.

                    <p>
                        If you were in the Warrants Table your ‘Search’ window would look like:
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        The only difference in the ‘Warrants’ Table search and the ‘Case’ Table search is on what you are searching. For warrants you may search by Defendant Name, Warrant Number, or Date Issued. Each Table has its own unique fields on which you can search.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If a table does not have many records, this ‘Search for’ window may be by-passed and a display of all the records appear. If you were in the ‘Case Type’ Table and pressed F1 you would see:
                    </p><br>
