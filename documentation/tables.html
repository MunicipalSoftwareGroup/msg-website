                        The Date the Defendant actually failed to appear. (Not

                        Click this button to create a new entry in the Party Data Grid.
                        A Party is any Person(Profile) attached to this case. Relationship
                        identifies how (or why) the person is involved in the case. Some Relationships include
                        ‘Arresting Officer’, ‘Assisting Officer’, ‘Attorney’, ‘Complainant’, ‘Surety’, etc.
                        The relationship list is viewed by pressing F4 or clicking on the down arrow. You may create your own custom relationships in the ‘Party Relationship’ under the Lookup Menu.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        Typing just a few letters in the relationship field will make the closest match. ‘Arr’ will produce ‘Arresting Officer’. What is displayed in the Name field is determined by the
                        Relationship Field. ‘Arresting Officer’, ‘Assisting Officer’, ‘Probation Officer’
                        must all be listed in the ‘Officers’ Table on the Parties Menus. Typing in a badge number should display that Officer. Most relationships (Such as ‘Complainant’ )
                        only require having a Profile Record. You may go to the actual “Relationship’ record
                        being displayed on this Data Grid by typing ‘Ctrl-B’ or Right Clicking on the
                        relationship and chosing ‘Browse’ from the menu or by Double Left Clicking to the
                        far left of the particular row on the Data Grid. This Relationship Record also contains
                        Subpoena information.

                    <i>ADJUDICATION FIELDS</i>
                    <img src="images/tables/image028.png"/>
                    <p>
                        There should be one possible Adjudication for each case (GUILTY, NOT GUILTY,
                        NOL PROS, DISMISSED, or YO GUILTY) with one possible Appealed Adjudication.
                        Other check boxes may be optionally checked such as Deferred Prosecution (sometimes
                        referred to as ‘Diversion’), Probation Services, Youthful Offender (you may check
                        Youthful Offender for any of the adjudications.), or Driving School. If the case is
                        Appealed, the date it was Appealed should be entered. Later there should be an
                        Appeal Adjudication and an Appeal Adjudication Date. Should the case be remanded
                        back, there is a check box to signify this.

                    <i>EVENTS</i>

                    <p>
                        The Events Data Grid works very similar to the Parties Data Grid above. An event
                        is anything related to the case. The Event List comes from the ‘Case Event Codes’ Table in the Case Menu. You may create any Event Title you wish. The possibilities
                        are limitless. Events are listed from the Most Recent Backwards. You may enter events by pressing the Add Event button. Some Events are automatically entered.
                        (upon printing particular forms, for example). If more events are present than are
                        able to be displayed, you may have to use scroll bars on the right to scroll down and
                        view older events.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>UTC SUSPENSION NOTICES</i>
                    <img src="images/tables/image030.png"/>
                    <p>
                        While Suspension and Clearance Notices could have been placed in the event data
                        grid above, they were purposely separated out to allow for possible future transfer
                        features. These fields are automatically filled with dates when the particular form
                        is printed.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>CASE NOTES</i>
                    <img src="images/tables/image031.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Anything you wish to type may be placed here. Simple Notations are probably better
                        entered in the Event Data Grid with the ‘Notation’ Event.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>ADDITONAL REQUIREMENTS</i>
                    <img src="images/tables/image032.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Requirements in addition to Fines and Costs may be placed here. If the ‘Case Remains
                        Open’ box is checked, the case will remain open even after it is paid off until a date
                        is entered in the ‘Completed’ field. Your requirements List comes from the ‘Case
                        Requirement Codes’ on the ‘Case Menu’
                    </p><br>

                    <i>JUDGES ORDERS</i>
                    <img src="images/tables/image033.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Judges Orders follows the flow of the Case Action Summary. While Plea and
                        Disposition are Drop Down Fields you may type 1 letter shortcuts such as
                        ‘G’ for Guilty and ‘N’ for Not Guilty. Since Case Action Summaries are normally
                        printed prior to the Judges Orders, it is optional as to whether this information is
                        entered here.
                    </p><br>

                    <i>BENCH NOTES</i>
                    <img src="images/tables/image034.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Any Bench Notes may be entered here. Clicking on the ‘B’ brings up a listing of
                        common Bench Notes used. This is useful if you have a lot of repeat Bench Notes.
                        The list comes from the ‘Bench Notes’ Table under the ‘Case Menu’. You may
                        type in Shortcuts for these ‘Bench Notes’.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        ‘Do Not Submit’ is placed here for future Possible use. ‘Manul Entry’ is checked if
                        you entered the Case Number yourself. (The system to generate the Case Number)
