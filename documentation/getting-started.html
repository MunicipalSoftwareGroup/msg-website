                        <p>
                            How about a few (yawn) definitions so that you will know whats being talked about?
                        </p><br>

                        <i> APPLICATION</i><br>
                        <p>
                            – the actual software program running on your computer. Also referred to as an ‘app’
                            or ‘program’. The icon you click on your screen ‘launches’ or starts running the 
                            application on your computer
                        </p><br>

                        <i> SQL</i><br>
                        <p>
                            – the type of database used to store all your records.  SQL stands for
                            Structured Query Language and is often referred to as ‘Sequel’.  
                            The data is stored on a SQL Server (either on your computer if it is
                            not on a network or on a Network Server).  On many of the report
                            screens you will  see the SQL language.  It often starts with 
                            ‘SELECT * FROM…’
                        </p><br>

                        <i>FOCUS</i><br>
                        <p>
                            – it is the point on the screen that currently has the attention of 
                            the computer.   If a data entry field has the focus, typing on the
                            keyboard will put the characters in that field.  If a screen or
                            data entry field has the focus, it signified in some way (Color Red or
                            Blue) so that you, the user, knows where you are on the screen. 
                        </p><br>

                        <i>TOOL BAR</i><br>
                        <p>
                            – A long, horizontal bar near the top of the Main Screen that contains
                            icons that may be clicked on to perform certain tasks.
                        </p><br>

                        <p>
                            – Small help words that appear when placing (not clicking) the mouse
                            over certain Data Fields or icons.   Used to help identify the name of the
                            the icon or data field and its intended use.
                        </p><br>


                        <i>STATUS BAR</i><br><br>
                        <img src="images/getting-started/image004.png" alt="Status Bar"><br>
                        <p>
                            – the horizontal bar across the bottom of the screen that
                            simply informs the status of certain items such as the current Table
                            Name,  Number of Records in the Table,  Current Date, etc.
                        </p><br>

                        <i>INFORMATION LINE</i><br><br>

                        <p>
                            – the horizontal line across the bottom that provides
                            certain information about what is  happening.  If the line
                            turns red,  an error has 	occurred.   The idea is to be less intrusive
                            with the errors and information so that you don’t have to take the
                            extra step of clicking on an error box every time.
                        </p><br>

                        <i>CURSOR</i><br>
                        <p>
                            – the flashing line or box that shows exactly where you are typing.
                        </p><br>

                        <i>BROWSE MODE</i><br> 
                        <p>
                            –  You are just looking at Data.  The focus is not on the data part
                            of the screen.  You are not adding or editing data.                      
                        </p><br>

                        <i>EDIT MODE</i><br> 
                        <p>
                            – Changing data on a record that was previously created.  If you
                            ESC (or abort) while in this mode, the record will go back to its original
                            data.
                        </p><br>
                        
                        <i>ADD MODE</i><br> 
                        <p>
                            -  Creating a record that was not previously there.   ESC will abort
                            the new record and it will not be saved.
                        </p><br>


                        <h3>Field Types</h3><br>

                        <p>
                            Fields are used to display or receive data.  The kind of data received and the
                            error checking that goes on depends on the type of field.  While check boxes,
                            buttons, etc. are not technically fields, they also are included here.
                        </p><br>


                        <i>FREE FORM FIELD</i><br><br>

                        <p>
                            – a data field in which anything may be typed. There is
                            no error checking.  
                        </p><br>

                        <i>DATE FIELD</i><br> 
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            Dates may be entered either with Year First dashes (2008-01-01)
                            or Month/Day/Year slashes (1/1/2008 or 1/1/08). If the year is
                            omitted, the current year is assumed. "2/25" would produce "02/25/2008".
                            Likewise, if both the month and the year are omitted, the current
                            month and year are used to format. "5" would produce "2/5/2008".
                            Just the letter ‘T’ placed in the date field will put in Today's date.

                            the F4 key.   The Up/Down arrow keys may be used

                            and DL Number (TX17034568), a search will be launched to locate that
                            Profile. If no Profile is found, you may do a right click to select
                            ‘Create New Profile’ or type CTRL-N to start the process of creating a new Profile.
