                    <h3>Print Menu</h3>
                    <p>
                        The PRINT Menu allows you to select a Form or a Report to Print.
                        Clicking on PRINT will reveal a Sub-Menu with various Print Categories which will in turn reveals another Sub-Menu from which the desired Form or Report may be selected. Clicking (or pressing enter) on a given Menu Item
                        will start the printing process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A Print Setup Window will then appear with various options relating to that particular Form or Report.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/printing/image001.png"/>
                    
                    <h3>Printing Total Receipts Report</h3>
                    <img src="images/printing/image002.png"/>
                    <p>
                        The ‘Total Receipts Report’ prints out monies received and disbursed for a given time period. After selecting the Total Receipts Report from the Print Menu (see ‘Print Menu’ section), the Initial Print Window appears:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Printer is set to the default printer. You may change this printer to any
                        printer you have installed on your computer. You may also alter the number
                        of copies to print. The ‘From Page:’ and ‘To Page:’ allow you to print only
                        certain pages of this report. If this was a 10 page report you could choose to
                        only print pages 7 through 9 if you wished. This might be helpful for printing
                        reports with lots of pages. You may only want the last page or you may have
                        printer problems after page 80 and not want to have to reprint the whole report. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/printing/image003.png"/>
                    
                    <p>
                        ‘Display Screen First’ allows you to look at the report in a standard
                        Print Viewer. You may then print the report from the viewer by
                        clicking on the printer in the upper left corner.
                    </p>

                    <i>POST DATES</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image004.png"/>
                    <p>Post Dates will default to the
                        current Post Date and may be
                        changed to be any range needed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/printing/image005.png"/>

                    <p>
                        The Initial Print Window defaults to all 4 reports being printed. You may
                        uncheck any report you do not want to print.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/printing/image006.png"/>
                    <p>
                        ‘Total Receipts’ is a row listing of all receipt numbers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/printing/image007.png"/>

                    <p>
                        ‘Drawer Summary’ is how the collections split out as in Cash, Check,
                        Money Order, Credit Card.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Normal Collections and Cash Bonds are totaled into the Total Received
                        column which should equal the drawer. ‘Bond Apply’ are bonds being applied to cases or being forfeited. Money should be transferred from the bond account and disbursed to the various Costs and Fines accounts.
                        ‘Bond Dispose’ are bonds that are returned or transferred to Circuit Court.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/printing/image008.png"/>

                    <p>
                        The ‘Account Summary’ report shows where the amounts received or applied should be disbursed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If these fines and costs have account numbers, the ‘General Ledger’ report will group the disbursements by these account numbers.
                    </p>

                    <i>BY CASHIER</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image009.png"/>
                    <p>
                        If ‘Separate by Cashier’ is checked and ‘Cashier Name’ contains a name, the
                        reports will be run for only this cashier. If ‘Separate by Cashier’ is checked
                        and ‘Cashier Name’ is empty, the reports will be run once for each cashier.
                        If ‘Separate by Cashier’ is not checked and ‘Cashier Name’ is empty. All totals are run together without regard to cashier.
                    </p>

                    <i>COMMAND</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image010.png"/>
                    <p>
                        The SQL Command at the bottom normally will not be used. It is displayed
                        so that it may be adjusted should the need for a customize report arise.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Court Docket Report</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Initial Print Screen for the Court Docket Report looks like this:
                        <img src="images/printing/image011.png"/>
                    </p>

                    <i>LANDSCAPE</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image012.png"/>
                    <p>
                        If Landscape is checked, ‘Events’ are in a separate column to the far right. If instead the docket is to be Portrait, ‘Events’ are placed under ‘Parties’
                    </p>

                    <i>COURT DATE, TIME, and TYPE</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image013.png"/>
                    <p>
                        A Court Date is required to print the docket. If ‘Time’ is left blank, all open
                        cases with that Court Date will be printed. If ‘Time’ is specified only open
                        cases with that Time will be included. Docket Type is handled the same
                        way. If you don’t specify a ‘Docket Type’ all open cases will be included without regard to what the ‘Docket Type’ is. Thus, you may optionally run dockets based on ‘Type’ for the same Court Date and Time. You may create your own customized ‘Docket Types’.
                    </p>

                    <i>PRE or POST TRIAL DOCKET</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image014.png"/>
                    <p>
                        A Docket normally just shows open cases with the current Court Date.
                        If you wish to see the cases that have been closed or continued and the current date is still prior to the actual Court Date, the ‘Pre or Post Trial Disposition’
                        should be checked. If you want just the closed and continued cases, leave
                        ‘Show All Cases’ blank. If you want all cases regardless of their state, then check ‘Show All Cases’. If the Docket is being run is after the specified Court Date and ‘Pre or Post Trial Disposition’ is checked, then the report is
                        considered a ‘Post Trial Disposition’. All cases scheduled for the specific Court Date will be displayed. (‘Show All Cases’ doesn’t matter at this point.)
                    </p>

                    <i>DISPLAY OPTIONS</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image015.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Display Options allow you to chose whether or not certain items will be on the
                        docket. ‘Display Charge Note on Docket’ determines if the ‘Note on Docket’ field from the ‘Charges’ Table is displayed by each case that has this charge. This note may be used as a policy or procedure note such as normal fines and
                        costs for this charge.
                    </p>

                    <i>OFFICER ORDER</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image016.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Dockets are normally ordered by ‘Defendant
                        Name’ so that all the defendants cases are
                        together. If instead (or in addition to) you would like the docket to be grouped by Police Officer so all the Police Officer’s cases are together, you should check the ‘Order by Arresting Officer’ box. You may also make each officers docket is on separate pages
                        by checking the ‘Separate Page per Arresting Officer’ box.
                    </p>

                    <i>CASE EXCLUDED FROM DOCKET</i>
                    <img src="images/printing/image017.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Each case has a check option to be
                        excluded from the docket for whatever
                        reason. Officers may also be excluded
                        from the docket. If these options are check on the cases, they will not appear on the docket if the ‘Recognize…’ options are checked here.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ‘State Monthly Reports’ prints the 3 forms required to be submitted
                        monthly to the state. The ‘State Treasurer Report’, ‘POA Report’, and
                        ‘Crime Victims Report’ all default to being checked. You may uncheck any
                        of them that you do not wish to run.

                    <p>
                        The Report Dates default to the previous month if the current date is in the first half of the month. If the current date is later in the month, the Report Dates will default to the current month. Regardless, you may alter the ‘Report Dates’ as needed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You may print a blank Case Action Summary, a single Case Action Summary,
                        or do multiple Case Action Summaries at one time. The default is to print
                        just a single. If you were in the ‘Cases’ Table, the record you were on
                        will be the default. Therefore, if you were just printing a single Case Action
                        Summary all you need to do at this point is press F9 or click OK. No changes would need to be made.
                    </p>

                    <i>MULTIPLE CASES</i>

                    <p>
                        If instead you wanted to print all or some of the Case Action Summaries for
                        a given court date, you may check the ‘Mult Cases’ box and the screen will
                        change based on the Court Date of the current case. The ‘Multiple Method’
                        defaults to ‘COURT DATE’, which uses the ‘Court Date’ fields right below it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now the Multiple Method is COURT DATE and all cases for that Court Date
                        are listed in the ‘Multi Cases’ Data Grid. You may now select or deselect
                        any case on that list for which to print a Case Action Summary by checking or unchecking the ‘Include’ box for that Case.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ‘Check All’ and ‘Uncheck All’ will allow you to either select or deselect
                        all the cases at once. The label to the right shows you how many cases are checked and thus how many ‘Case Action Summaries’ will be printed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/printing/image032.png"/>
                    
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, you may fill the
                        ‘Multi Case’ grid with all
                        cases Entered on particular
                        date or a given case number
                        range. You may also specify
                        only cases that are open.
                        The appropriate fields below the ‘Multiple Method’ are then used. As these
                        ‘Case Action Summaries’ are printed, the Events data grid for each case is
                        updated with this fact. If you do not want the Events data grid to be updated
                        check the ‘Do Not Update Events’:
